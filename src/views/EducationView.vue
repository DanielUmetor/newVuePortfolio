          <h3>Intern at LC Studio</h3>
          <p>September 2024 - Present</p>
          <p>
            At LC Studio, I gained hands-on experience in WordPress website development, collaborating with experienced developers on various projects. 
            This opportunity helped refine my understanding of front-end and back-end development and strengthened my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and working within a team-oriented environment.
